Wheatbin is Project Management Software that combines Kanban with the **[Law of the Harvest]** philosophy. Wheatbin helps you sow, grow and harvest all your hard work.

[Wheatbin] is a software fork of [Kanboard] v1.0.22 by Frédéric Guillot (see the [diff]). It's a <strong>major overhaul of the UX/IU</strong> with mobile devices being the first consideration in the redesign. 

And as with Kanboard, Wheatbin includes:

- Multiple boards with the ability to drag and drop tasks
- Open source and self-hosted
- Super simple installation
- Distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE)

See the **installation [instructions]**.

For Kanboard specific issues, go to [upstream] from/or the wheatbin [fork] please.
